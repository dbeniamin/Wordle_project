Wordle Homework !

	Welcome all to my Wordle project that aims to improve your geographical knowledge and challenge you to get good.

This app is a wordle type app that works with 5 letter countries imported from a separate list. 

	It randomizes the entry every time you play while respecting the basic wordle color code for letters.Gray if the letter in your input word is not in the word chosen by the app, yellow if a letter from the input word exists in the chosen app word, green if a letter from the input word exists in the chosen app word and its in the correct location (1-5) as the chosen app word.

The app was build using python due to the relative easy use of pygame module and how python code when you have to define a interface with colors, shapes, sizes, etc.

	The modules provided in python made the transfer, from a .py file filed with code that can only be runed on python interpreters to a .exe that can be used on all computers without having the need of a code interpreter, very easy. 
	The “-- onefile” command made it possible to compile all the information from the .py file in to one executable file, along with the “-w” that will not open the console while de game is running.

	To install / run the project you just have to run the wordle.exe and make sure you have the 
WordList.txt in the same folder as the executable file and just start guessing the countries from the WordList.txt. 
	This project was made to open up an interface that awaits your input and will provide the answer based on the user input.

	The format of the word does not matter, upper case and lower case, both work due to the program written to transform all letters to uppercase.
